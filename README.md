# Programming Fundamentals - Consolidation Task

This project is a solution to the below problem, given in Week 4 of the course at CodeClan in Edinburgh.

# The Brief

Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

Your assignment is an opportunity to practice all or some of these principles. Next Thursday you can do a short presentation on what you have achieved and learned.


## Harvey's Music Store

The owner of Harveyâ€™s Music Store, Harvey, wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels, see what he needs to order soon and what is in stock.

You should be able to add to Stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available. He would ideally like to:

- Inventory page
	- Show stock level of all items:
		- High/Medium/Low based on quantity
- Add albums
- Add artists
- Add stock

Further analysis could be added, for example:
- Create route that sends down Inventory data as JSON
- Work out the markup for each product ( there could be a buy price and a sell price )
	- Total possible sales & markup on inventory page
- Search functionality on Inventory page
- Associated Genre (Harvey associates one Genre to Artists)
